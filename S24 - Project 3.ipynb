    "## Project Description\n",
    "In this project you will perform network analysis on a subset of an Amazon co-purchasing network created by [Leskovec et al. (2007)](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~jure/pubs/viral-tweb.pdf).  The dataset contains various product networks including books, DVDs, and videos. It was collected by crawling the Amazon website in March 2003 according to *Customers Who Bought This Item Also Bought* product relationships. Thus, if product *A* is always co-purchased with product *B*, the graph contains a **directed** edge from *A* to *B*.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data\n",
    "There are **two data files** associated with this project:\n",
    "- *amazon_graph.txt*: This file contains the data for Part 1. It contains 16,552 observations (edges) of two (2) numbers representing product IDs. Each node represents a product and each directed edge between two nodes represents a co-purchase. The column fromNodeId contains the ID of the main purchasing item and ToNodeId contains the ID of the co-purchased items.\n",
    "- *ratings_train.csv*: This file contains the *training* data for Part 2. It contains 8,250 observations of Amazon product ratings. The `avg_rating` column contains the average rating by Amazon customers on a scale of 0-5.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Software Packages\n",
    "The following Python software packages are required to complete the project:\n",
    "- `pandas`\n",
    "- `numpy`\n",
    "- `scikit-learn`\n",
    "- `matplotlib`\n",

    "### Network Analysis Tutorials\n",
    "1. Read the article [Social Network Analysis in Python](https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/social-network-analysis-python) to understand the basics of (social) network snalysis.\n",
    "2. Review the [`NetworkX` Tutorial](https://networkx.org/documentation/stable/tutorial.html) to understand how you can use the `NetworkX` library to create and analyze graphs in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Network Analysis\n",
    "After reading the above references, perform some basic network analyses and briefly explain each of your findings:\n",
    "1. Load the **directed** network graph ($G$) from the `GRAPH_FILE`. You may use `NetworkX`'s [`read_edgelist` function](https://networkx.org/documentation/stable/reference/readwrite/generated/networkx.readwrite.edgelist.read_edgelist.html#read-edgelist) for this purpose.\n",
    "   How many items are present in the network and how many co-purchases are present?\n",
    "2. Compute the average shortest distance between all nodes in $G$. Explain your results briefly.\n",
    "3. Compute the *transitivity* and the average *clustering coefficient* of the network graph $G$. Explain your findings briefly based on the definitions of clustering coefficient and transitivity.\n",
    "4. Apply the PageRank algorithm to network $G$ with damping value 0.5 and find the 10 nodes with the highest PageRank. Explain your findings briefly.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Additional Resources\n",
    "1. [`NetworkX` API documentation](https://networkx.org/documentation/stable/reference/index.html)\n",

For this problem, the $\\mathbf{x}\\in\\mathcal{X}$ values will be vectors of 4 or more features derived from the network, while the $y\\in \\mathcal{Y}$ values will be the average rating. The general process for training a model in `Scikit-learn` is as follows (using `LinearRegression` as an example):\n",

    "4. `mae_train = mean_absolute_error(Y_train,Y_train_pred) #Test model performance based on an appropriate metric.`\n",
    "\n",
    "Line 4 above measures the performance of the model on the same data that it was trained with. This is to gauge how well the model fit the data and provides a baseline for performance when you apply the model to the test set. Typically, model performance new, unseen data (e.g., the test set) will decrease. This decrease is the *generalization error* of the model.\n",
